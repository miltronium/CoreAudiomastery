## Tutorial Design Principles

### 1. Hands-On Learning Priority
- **Every concept demonstrated through working code**
- **Progressive complexity**: Build from simple to production-quality
- **Real-world applicability**: All examples directly relevant to Apple audio engineering

### 2. Repository Development Strategy
- **Dual Repository Approach**:
  - `CoreAudioTutorial`: Step-by-step tutorial progression with session logs
  - `CoreAudioMastery`: Final study guide implementation following repository structure
- **Strategic Commits**: Major milestones committed for easy rollback and reference
- **Documentation Integration**: README files and learning notes maintained throughout

### 3. Language Mastery Progression
- **Isolation First**: Master each language independently
- **Strategic Integration**: Smart bridging patterns, not forced combinations
- **Production Standards**: Code quality meets Apple engineering standards
