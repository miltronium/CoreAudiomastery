## Study Guide Philosophy

**Target Outcome**: Enable a computer science undergraduate to progress from introductory programming knowledge to shipping production-quality features on Apple's audio teams (GarageBand, Logic, MainStage, Voice Memos) on day one.

### Learning Progression

1. **Foundation Setup** (Day 1-2) - Development environment and build tools
2. **Chapter Implementations** (Days 3-21) - Progressive skill building
3. **Integration Projects** (Days 22-28) - Real-world applications
4. **Interview Preparation** (Ongoing) - Technical and behavioral readiness

### Multi-Language Architecture

Each chapter follows a consistent progression:

- **C Implementation**: System-level understanding and Core Audio fundamentals
- **C++ Implementation**: Performance optimization and modern practices  
- **Objective-C Implementation**: Apple framework integration patterns
- **Swift Implementation**: Modern Apple development with SwiftUI showcase

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Working knowledge of C, Xcode, and Objective-C
2. **Setup**: Follow the tutorial setup in the companion CoreAudioTutorial repository
