# Chapter 1: Overview of Core Audio

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Core Audio's role in Apple's audio ecosystem
- Master the property-driven API pattern and its advantages
- Build and debug Core Audio applications using Audio Toolbox

- [ ] **Professional**: CloudKit sync and Core Data integration

### Swift Implementation
- [ ] **Basic**: Modern Swift patterns with async/await
- [ ] **Enhanced**: Combine framework service layer
- [ ] **Professional**: Complete AudioMetadataKit framework + SwiftUI app

## Core Concepts

### Property-Driven APIs
Understanding how Core Audio uses key-value pairs for functionality access, with properties being enumerated integers and values of various types.

### Error Handling Patterns
Mastering OSStatus return codes, four-character code interpretation, and professional error propagation strategies.

### Memory Management
Proper handling of Core Foundation objects, toll-free bridging, and resource cleanup in different language contexts.
